> :iphone: Basic bank account mobile app created for learning Flutter.

## Web API

In order to test this app locally, you'll need to run an API server that can be found on [this repository](https://github.com/yagopessoa/bytebank-api).

Also, you'll need to change the `_apiDomain` constant on `lib/api/clients/transaction_client.dart`.
